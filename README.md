## Installing Expo 

Download the Expo App on your mobile device. You will need to sign up for an account. Once logged in, take a picture of the QR code in the browser window that was launched when you started the app. This will then open up the app on your mobile device.

## Setting up a firebase account

1. Go to Google Firebase and click on “Sign in”
2. Click on the “Go to console” link and click on "Create Project"
3. A form will appear asking for basic information.
4. Give a project name.
5. With the default settings selected, agree to the terms and click “Create Project.”
6. Create a database, click on “Develop” from the menu on the left-hand side.
7. From the additional menu that appears, select “Database”.
8. Choose “Create database” in the Cloud Firestore section.
9. Make sure to create a Firestore Database—not a “Realtime Database.”
